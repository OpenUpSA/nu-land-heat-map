              Ndifuna Ukwazi is a non-profit activist organisation and law
              centre that combines research, community organising and litigation
              in campaigns to advance urban land justice in Cape Town. Our
              primary mission is to expand and protect access to affordable
              housing towards building a more just and equal city. We have
              created this map with the aim of raising awareness around the
              amount of available public land in Cape Town, and to invite the
              public to participate in conceptualising how these underutilised
              and vacant spaces can and should be used differently to build a
              more just future. This map is a challenge to the national,
              provincial and local government’s lack of transparency around
              public land, poor public participation around decisions on public
              land, and the way in which it traditionally engages with issues of
              land and housing.

              <p>
                Due to the lack of publicly available information on publicly
                owned land within the Cape Town Municipality, it became
                necessary for us to develop a methodology to build a database
                ourselves. The aim of this database was to more fully understand
                how much public land each sphere of government owns that is
                vacant and underutilised. The idea is that by demonstrating how
                much public land is available for social good such as the
                development of housing, all three spheres of government will no
                longer be able to perpetuate the myth that there is a shortage
                of land that can be used to address the housing crisis. While
                not entirely accurate, this map is based on the most accurate
                publically available data. The map aims to provide an overall
                picture of the vast amount of vacant and underutilised public
                land at a moment in time. The data collection for this map was
                done between 2018 and 2022. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This methodology entailed a desktop study that used a visual
                assessment of publicly available aerial imagery of land that
                appears to be vacant or underutilised. Once seemingly vacant or
                underutilised land was identified, we used the City of Cape
                Town&#x27;s online tools to establish ownership and further
                details of individual sites. Wherever possible we made use of
                the City of Cape Town’s own online tools to identify property
                owners on the understanding that as the municipality, they
                should have the most accurate data on public land within their
                boundaries. This also means that all data used already exists in
                the public realm. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Public land is publicly owned and by extension belongs to all of
                us. However, despite our best efforts to access information on
                public land through formal requests to the City of Cape Town,
                this data is generally inaccessible to the general public.
                Either the data is located in different formats across multiple
                digital platforms or the ownership information is not readily
                available. We aim to bring public land into the public domain.
                This map is not a tool to encourage land occupations or
                speculation by the private sector, but is rather a tool to
                promote accountability and stimulate the public imagination.
              </p>
              <h2>Layer 1: Vacant and Underutilised public land</h2>
              <h3>
                Step 1: Visually identifying vacant or underutilised sites
              </h3>
              <p>
                Firstly, as a proxy for vacant and underutilised land we would
                do a systematic visual search, area by area, on both Google Maps
                and the City of Cape Town’s
                <a href="https://citymaps.capetown.gov.za/EGISViewer/"
                  >City Map and Zoning Viewer</a
                >
                for sites that appear from a birds eye view to be vacant or
                underutilised. We made use of a list of suburbs and used roads
                and other physical structuring elements of each area to ensure
                that areas were visually surveyed meticulously. The City Map and
                Zoning Viewer is publically available through the City of Cape
                Town’s Planning Portal and provides spatial details across the
                metro. For the City’s own description of the tool see:
                <a
                  href="https://www.capetown.gov.za/work%20and%20business/planning-portal/online-planning-and-building-resources/online-zoning-viewer"
                  >here</a
                >. 
              </p>
              <p>
                On the City Map and Zoning Viewer we used the latest aerial
                photography layer, which was from 2018 when this process began.
                Google Maps has updated their aerial photography over the years
                that we have been collecting this data, with the aerial
                photography being from 2021 at the time of launching this map.
                Because land ownership changes over time and public land will
                continue to be bought and sold once we launch this map, this map
                provides a look into public land ownership during the period of
                time that we have been creating this map, i.e. 2018 - 2022. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Determining what is ‘vacant or underutilised’ from aerial
                photography alone is a subjective assessment of a piece of land.
                <strong
                  >A clear limitation of this approach is that these sites have
                  not been ground-checked. Furthermore no analysis of government
                  planning documents have been done to assess whether any
                  specific site identified is currently leased out by government
                  or has been earmarked or reserved by government for specific
                  use and/or delivery. Very limited analysis has been done on
                  the commitment of well-located sites for affordable

                This means that we have collected this data on the basis of what
                appears vacant and underutilised from a bird&#x27;s eye
                perspective to provide a city-wide overview of the extent of
                public land that could be used better. It would be necessary for
                any map-user to conduct their own ground level assessment  and
                assessment of government planning documents should they wish to
                get a more complete, accurate and deeper understanding of any
                specific site.

              <p>
                Please note that for capacity reasons the areas of Parow,
                Belhar, Milnerton, Elsies River, Kuils River, Delft and Blouberg
                have only been partially mapped. This means that the map
                provides a conservative estimate of public land. This is only
                the first iteration of the map, and we hope to more fully survey
                these areas in future versions.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is also worth noting that the current version of the map does
                not attribute environmentally sensitive land parcels, and that
                this is another reason why some of the land on the map may not
                be suitable for development. We have endeavoured to avoid
                including land parcels that are clearly environmentally
                sensitive or inappropriate for development.

                The criteria used to identify vacant and underutilised land is
                as follows:

              <p>
                We looked visually on the aerial photography of an area for
                sites that were not at all, or not entirely built up. We have
                included parking lots, open land, golf courses, schools with
                large grounds and other sports grounds in this assessment. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This does not mean that we think that affordable housing should
                be built on all available open or green space across the city.
                Rather, when looked at holistically it is clear that the state
                is not making use of the well-located land that it owns in an
                equitable and efficient way that balances the pressing demand
                for affordable housing with the need for open green space and
                uses for public good. The need to look not just to empty but
                also to partially used public land is in line with a growing
                need for underutilised public land that is used for schools,
                parks and more to be intensified and used to its full potential.
                For instance, the African Centre for Cities has
                <a
                  href="https://www.africancentreforcities.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IS_Publication_Official.pdf"

                >
                as a way of densifying, activating an increasing safety of the
                area while providing inclusive housing opportunities.

              <p>
                As it is near impossible to establish from aerial imagery
                whether a building, rather than a piece of land, is vacant or
                underutilised, this means that there are many sites that in
                reality stand vacant and underutilised that are not included in
                this database, making it a conservative estimate. 
              </p>
              <h4><strong>2. Size: </strong></h4>
              <p>
                We have only included sites that are over roughly 1000m<sup
                  >2</sup
                >
                that appear from the aerial imagery to be vacant or
                underutilised. This is due to the fact that it is highly
                unlikely that it would be feasible to develop affordable housing
                on a site smaller than this. This means that this map does not
                capture all vacant and underutilised public land and is
                therefore a conservative estimate.

                Step 2: Establishing whether the vacant or underutilised site is
                publicly owned
              </h3>
              <p>
                Once a site was visually identified as vacant or underutilised,
                we established whether the land is publicly owned. In order to
                do this, we referred back to the City of Cape Town’s
                <a href="https://citymaps.capetown.gov.za/EGISViewer/"
                  >City Map and Zoning Viewer</a
                >
                to establish the erf number and/or address. We used this
                information to search for the ownership of the site by searching
                the erf number or address on the latest publicly available
                <a
                  href="https://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/gv2018/SearchProperty"
                  >General Valuations Roll</a
                >, from 2018. This is used as it is the most recent record of
                municipal valuations for Cape Town that is publicly available.
                Where we cannot establish ownership on the 2018 General
                Valuations Roll due to missing or incomplete data, we have in
                some instances used the
                <a href="https://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/GV2015/"
                  >2015 General Valuations Roll</a
                >
                or an online property platform to confirm ownership.

              <h3>
                Step 3: Recording publicly owned vacant or underutilised land 
              </h3>
              <p>
                Once we have established that a site is both visually vacant or
                underutilised <em>and</em> publicly owned, we then record the
                details of that site in our database. We include in our database
                additional information from both the City Map and Zoning Viewer
                and the General Valuations Roll including the size, zoning and
                value of the site. We have often had to group multiple erven
                together into one piece of land when they could functionally
                form an individual site. Ideally, the City would be
                consolidating these parcels of land itself in order to maximise
                their potential.  
              </p>
              <h3>Step 4: Tracking progress of mapping</h3>
              <p>
                As a final step in the data collection process, we have created
                a Google Map to track the public land we’ve captured as we go.
                The primary purpose of this was to increase accuracy by helping
                us to gauge our progress and make sure we had mapped
                systematically across the city and had not missed any suburbs or
                areas. This included capturing sites that were privately owned
                to ensure efficiency and avoid the re-checking of sites. This
                step also created a proto-type map that assisted in our
                imagining and thinking around the final public land map output.

              <p>
                As mentioned above an assessment of government planning
                documents has not been done as part of this work. However, a
                layer has been developed on the map which includes notable
                commitments for affordable housing in well-located areas by
                various spheres of government. News outlets as well as
                government documents, speeches and media statements were used to
                provide the most accurate publicly available information about
                these commitments including what the commitment was and the
                status of that commitment. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, for the 11 Woodstock, Salt River and Inner City
                Precinct Affordable Housing Prospectus Sites announced by the
                City in 2017, we collected information about the sites and what
                was planned for them in the
                <a
                  href="https://www.tct.gov.za/docs/categories/1313/TDA_Inner_City_Housing_Prospectus_Interactive_28092017.pdf"

                  Affordable Housing Prospectus document</a

                and since then have used the City’s media statements, public
                participation processes and public forums to collect information
                on the progress on the commitments. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The City Map and Zoning Viewer and the General Valuations Roll
                were used to supplement additional information about the various
                sites including the size, zoning and value. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Progress on these commitments made after the launch of this map
                will not be updated. This means that what you are looking at is
                a moment in time and some additional progress may have been made
                on these promises by the time you are seeing this.
