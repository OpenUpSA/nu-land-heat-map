              Ndifuna Ukwazi is a non-profit activist organisation and law
              centre that combines research, community organising and litigation
              in campaigns to advance urban land justice in Cape Town. Our
              primary mission is to expand and protect access to affordable
              housing towards building a more just and equal city. We have
              created this map with the aim of raising awareness around the
              amount of available public land in Cape Town, and to invite the
              public to participate in conceptualising how these underutilised
              and vacant spaces can and should be used differently to build a
              more just future. This map is a challenge to the national,
              provincial and local government’s lack of transparency around
              public land, poor public participation around decisions on public
              land, and the way in which it traditionally engages with issues of
              land and housing.

                An overwhelming reluctance to use well located public land for
                affordable housing
              </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="story-content w-richtext">
              <p>
                Despite the abundance of available public land, we have seen
                very few well-located land parcels being committed for
                affordable housing. Progress has largely been painfully slow on
                the few commitments that have been secured and some projects
                seem to have stopped progressing altogether. While the City of
                Cape Town has made far more commitments than the provincial or
                national governments, all three spheres of government are
                failing to act with the necessary urgency. As a result, our
                housing crisis grows in scale and intensity every year. Scroll
                down to learn more about some of the public commitments that
                have been made and where progress currently stands. 
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                When well-located public land is committed for affordable
                housing, it takes too long or never happens.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The housing and segregation crisis in Cape Town is urgent, with
                more people forced to live in terrible conditions everyday. The
                few commitments that the state has made to develop well-located
                public land for affordable housing have not been delivered with
                the priority and speed that the situation demands. For example,
                Salt River Market was identified by City officials as early as
                2008, but 15 years later the project has not broken ground.

                      Residentially led mixed-use high-density development which
                      includes open market rental homes but aims to maximise the
                      provision of social and affordable rental housing. While
                      there has been an intention to redevelop the site since at
                      least 2012 as part of the Western Cape Provincial
                      Government&#x27;s Cape Town Central City Regeneration
                      Programme, the official inclusion of affordable and/or
                      social housing in the project was confirmed in 2020 when
                      the Province released the details of the project through a
                      questionnaire for prospective developers, social housing
                      institutions and funders. There has been little to no

                      Woodstock, Salt River and Inner City Precinct Affordable
                      Housing Prospectus as a site to be handed over to a
                      private developer to build a mixed-income development
                      including at least 300 social housing apartments. In
                      November 2020, after years of inaction, the City published
                      a notice announcing its plans to lease the Newmarket
                      Street site to a private company, Growthpoint, to be used
                      as a parking lot for three years. After objections from
                      Ndifuna Ukwazi and the City&#x27;s Human Settlements
                      Department, the City decided to abandon this lease. In May
                      2021, the City announced that it planned to lease the site
                      to the City’s Human Settlements Department instead, to
                      enable the Department to develop social housing on the
                      site. In terms of the City’s notice, the land will be
                      leased to the Department for 30 years at a nominal rental
                      of R150 per year. The City embarked on a parallel rezoning
                      process. No tangible progress on site.

                      The City of Cape Town released a prospectus in 2016
                      calling for proposals for the precinct. The City intended
                      to release the land to the private sector for mixed use
                      development with a focus on addressing congestion and
                      transport through the area and a residential component
                      that provides for "a diverse cross-section of income
                      groups". The City did not not specify the amount or nature
                      of affordable housing in their Prospectus so it was up to
                      the private sector to decide this. After 6 proposals were
                      exhibited for public input, the bid evaluation process was
                      completed in February 2018 and Mitchell Du Plessis
                      Associates (MDA) was announced as the winner. The winning
                      proposal would complete the unfinished highways and build
                      roughly 450 affordable homes and 3200 market related
                      homes. However, avoidable errors in the procurement
                      process scuppered the project and ultimately led to the
                      request for proposals being cancelled in July 2018. To
                      date the RFP has not been relaunched and the project has
                      subsequently been deleted from the City's Integrated
                      Development Plan. There has been no further progress
                      whatsoever.

                      The site was meant to be developed into a mixed use
                      development including affordable and/or social housing.
                      The City of Cape Town&#x27;s 2018 Municipal Spatial
                      Development Framework outlines that &quot;City-led
                      interventions are already being planned and implemented to
                      support the Urban Inner Core. These include affordable/
                      social housing projects in... the Athlone Power
                      Station&quot;. The idea of having affordable housing at
                      Athlone Power Station started at least 8 years prior when
                      in 2010 a pre-feasibility report commissioned by the City
                      of Cape Town looked at four scenarios of how the site
                      could be developed. One of the scenarios was a mixed-use
                      community including a &quot;range of medium and higher
                      density housing options (including GAP housing)&quot;.
                      Development of the site was stalled in 2012 due to alleged
                      tender irregularities that led to the tender allocation
                      for the decommissioning of the site to Aurecon being set
                      aside by the Western Cape High Court. In 2015 the City
                      Council allocated R2.3 million for the project to be
                      picked back up alongside a team from the World Bank who
                      would work on the development strategy. No progress has
                      been made. In a 2021 open letter Mayor Dan Plato indicated
                      that there were &quot;plans for a renewable energy hub at
                      the Athlone Power Station&quot;. This casts serious doubt
                      on whether affordable housing will ever be built on the
                      site.

                      one of the catalytic projects in the Table Bay area that
                      provides &quot;opportunities to advance spatial
                      transformation on state owned land&quot;. The City said
                      the site is to be investigated together with the next door
                      Rondebosch Golf Course (also on City land) for its
                      potential contribution to promoting inward growth, spatial
                      justice, improved access to high quality open space and to
                      rationalise the provision of public golf facilities. The
                      City indicated it would do a feasibility study on the part
                      of the site that is not in the 1:100 year floodplain for
                      mixed use development with 30% affordable or social
                      housing. It appears that the City has been working on
                      pre-feasibility studies in the background, and it once
                      again confirmed its commitment to developing the site in
                      April 2023.

                      During 2019, in response to the legal challenge against
                      the Western Cape Provincial Government to stop the sale of
                      the Tafelberg site, the Province stated in their court
                      papers that Moray Place was in the housing pipeline. For
                      many years provincial politicians have said that Moray
                      place would be a suitable site for housing, but no firm
                      plans have been announced. While small portions of Moray
                      Place are used for existing housing, a school field, and a
                      private soccer club, the majority of this extremely
                      well-located site has been vacant and underutilised for
                      several decades. The site is zoned for development and is
                      highly suitable for mixed-income housing. There is no
                      justifiable reason for the lack of progress.

                      The City announced in 2017 that the site would be turned
                      into a mixed-income development by a private developer
                      which would include a minimum of 600 social housing units.
                      The 2017 commitment follows many earlier commitments to
                      use the site for affordable housing, some of which go as
                      far back as 2008. The City has embarked on the process of
                      obtaining land use management and environmental approvals
                      for the project to include only 400 social housing
                      apartments. The City has not yet appointed a Social
                      Housing Institution and/or developer to develop the site.

                      Assigned to the Social Housing Institution Communicare for
                      mixed use development including social and GAP housing.
                      Although this site was identified for affordable housing
                      as early as 2008, the Salt River Market project has been
                      delayed due to challenges around the disposal of the land.
                      The City says that this project is also “nearing
                      construction phase” for development, which includes 200
                      social housing units.

                      After considerable public pressure, the WCPG published a
                      feasibility study proposing a mixed-use development on the
                      Tafelberg site. The study shows that it is feasible to
                      build 270 Social Housing flats on the land, with rentals
                      starting at R1000 per month. Ndifuna Ukwazi submitted a
                      counter proposal that demonstrated it was feasible to have
                      up to 316 social housing and 121 market rate homes on the
                      site. Six additional counter proposals from firms and
                      built environment professionals confirmed that more than
                      270 social housing units were possible. No progress has
                      been made and the Province is in court to avoid being
                      compelled to use the land for affordable housing.

                      49% of the residential development has been allocated to
                      grant-funded housing, which consists of social housing,

                      In a letter to Ndifuna Ukwazi on 29 May 2018, Deputy Mayor
                      Ian Neilson said: “It is our intention to have a mixed-use
                      development which includes affordable housing and will be
                      informed by the outcome of the required statutory
                      processes and the most feasible modelling to ensure a
                      successful development.” Former MAYCO Member Brett Herron
                      went further. He said the City would build a mixed-use
                      development including affordable housing on the Green
                      Point Bowling Green for residents earning between R1,500
                      and R15,000 a month. Just like at the Salt River Market,
                      the City would lease or sell the land to a social housing
                      company at a nominal amount keeping the homes affordable
                      for many years. But on 14th of November 2018 Brett Herron
                      said, “...a cabal is blocking the progress of that
                      project… they have told the officials and other
                      politicians that it is too close to the election to
                      proceed with the project.” The new mayor has committed to
                      investigating the site for affordable housing, but in the
                      meantime a fully developed plan for how housing could be
                      built there has been gathering dust in the Civic Centre
                      for years and is now out of date.

                      The City has claimed since 2008 that the site will be
                      developed into affordable housing. More recently, the City
                      announced in 2017 that the Woodstock Hospital would become
                      a mixed-income development by a private developer that
                      would include a minimum of 700 social housing units. The
                      site is currently occupied by poor and working class
                      families, who renamed their home Cissie Gool House. In
                      2021 the City initiated eviction proceedings. The
                      residents continue to fight for a collaborative upgrading
                      process.

                      developed into affordable housing. More recently, the site
                      was assigned to the Social Housing Institution SOHCO along
                      with Dillon Lane (as one project) as part of the
                      multi-phase development of 240 social housing units. The
                      Pine Road Social Housing project is in the final stages
                      before construction begins, making it the most advanced of
                      the other Woodstock/ Salt River prospectus projects. The
                      project will consist of 243 social housing apartments
                      targeted at families with a household income between R1
                      850 and R18 000 per month. The development is solely
                      residential ranging from two to four storey walk-ups in a
                      courtyard block style with a public square in the centre.
                      In 2020, the project was delayed due to serious funding
                      constraints.

                      in the same deed of sale as the Pine Road site in November
                      2019. After delays in obtaining planning approvals as a
                      result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the City secured the
                      planning approvals needed in late 2021. The City says that
                      the project is “nearing construction phase” with the next
                      step being “the submission of the Site Development Plan
                      (SDP) to further prepare the site for the commencement of
                      the construction.”

                      The City claimed in 2017 that it would develop
                      approximately 43 transitional housing units. It is
                      possible that this transitional housing will be used to
                      relocate people currently living on the Salt River Market
                      site. However, to date there has been no progress on the
                      site and the land has not been released. Planning
                      approvals are currently being acquired to develop the site
                      for roughly 34 social housing units, but there are
                      concerns within the City that the site will never be
                      developed as intended.

                      In 2017 the City, in its prospectus, called on private
                      developers to submit proposals for the development of the
                      Fruit and Veg site for the development of affordable
                      housing. After the City abandoned the process when it
                      didn’t open any of the proposals, there was uncertainty
                      about the future of the site. The City claims that this
                      site, which it estimates can accommodate approximately 150
                      units, is in “early feasibility stage”. However, since
                      these commitments the City has continued its lease of part
                      of the land to Fruit and Veg (for the Food Lover&#x27;s
                      Market), has leased another part of the land to
                      Streetscapes (for a food garden and employment project),
                      and recently erected a sign on the site that says “City of
                      Cape Town: Construction of new and rehabilitation of
                      existing non-motorised transport facilities”. The rest of
                      the site is being used as a parking lot. This suggests
                      that if this land is going to be used for affordable
                      housing, it will not be any time soon.

                      Initially, the City of Cape Town released the site to
                      Standard Bank and the developer Calgro M3 in the mid-2000s
                      for the construction of affordable housing. However,
                      Standard Bank pulled out during the global financial
                      crisis and the site then remained undeveloped for some
                      time. More recently, the land was handed over to the
                      Social Housing Institution Madulamoho who then developed a
                      204 apartment social housing project on the site. The
                      project was completed in March 2023 and leases have
                      already been signed for 90% of the apartments, once again
                      demonstrating the significant demand for social housing in
                      well-located areas.

                      In 2018 the City announced that it would develop a number
                      of pieces of public land in Parow into social housing,
                      including land near Parow Station. The land has been
                      divided into four sub-precincts and will apparently be
                      developed sequentially. However, since the announcement of
                      the precinct plan was made by politicians who are no
                      longer part of the City, it is not clear if they will
                      still be developed in this manner. Two properties within
                      the Parow Precinct have recently been advertised for
                      transfer to social housing institutions. Collectively,
                      these two pieces of land will deliver roughly 600 social
                      housing units.
